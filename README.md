# Redmine Statusboard

Just a humble Redmine Statusboard, in Flask.
It just displays open issues from a given project.

## Getting started

In a virtualenv, you can install the requirements from `requirements.txt`:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may want to take a look at `config.py` before launching your instance, with:

```
python app.py
```
